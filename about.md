Hi, my name is [Alex Ilyenko](https://assada.github.io/), and I'm a software developer in Montreal outsourcing company - [Reactorbits](http://reactorbits.com/).

My current location is near Kiev, in Ukraine.

On the web and with friends, I am also known as "Assada", which has been my nickname since a long time ago.

I work on various open-source PHP projects, and am typically paid to work with backend PHP application architecture.

You should probably also know that I do not have a sleep schedule, which means that I am usually awake whenever there is work to do.

You can contact me through my email address, [assada.ua@gmail.com](mailto:assada.ua@gmail.com), or Telegram by my cool nickname [@figushki](https://t.me/figushki).

You can also say "hi" to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/assada_ua), where I post professional and personal thoughts, suggestions, rants and silly things that I find on the intertubes.
